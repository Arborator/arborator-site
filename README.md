Arborator Site
===============

Arborator Site is a graphical tool which allows to browse treebanks graphically. It was initially made for the [RHAPSODIE](http://www.projet-rhapsodie.fr/) projet purposes. Its main assets are :
- create multiple projects with metada, licence information, project descriptions, etc. and save them.
- generate server ready web interface from your project
- no need to change your data ! With [Arborator's engine](http://arborator.ilpga.fr/), it reads most common treebank data and even oral speeches treebanks !
- Fast interface
- etc.


The actual version is [0.9.2-beta](https://github.com/Arborator/arborator-site/releases/tag/0.9.2-beta). 

The manager UI is an evolution of [this tutorial from code.makery](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/ "code.makery tutorial") with several additionnal features.
